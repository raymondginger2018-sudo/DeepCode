"""Shared assembly of a coding :class:`AgentSession` for every frontend.

The TUI (``cli.tui``), the headless entry (``cli.exec_cli``), and the web
backend (``agent_chat_service``) all need the same wiring: resolve a
provider, build the native tool set, attach the P1 permission engine, and
construct an :class:`AgentSession` armed with the model catalog's context
window. One assembly function keeps them in lockstep.

Lives in ``core`` (not ``cli``) deliberately: it is frontend-neutral, and
the web backend must not import through the top-level ``cli`` package —
that name is generic enough to be shadowed by third-party ``cli``
distributions on some interpreters (observed in the conda env), which is
exactly the module-shadowing failure mode the backend's path setup warns
about.
