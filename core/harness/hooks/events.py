"""Hook event names and matcher semantics (C3).

A faithful port of the reference agent's hook matcher logic
(``hooks/src/events/common.rs``), adapted to Python. The wire format is the
Claude-Code-compatible hooks schema, so a hook the user already wrote for that
ecosystem runs here unchanged.

Event names (as they appear in ``hooks.json`` and in the JSON payload's
``hook_event_name`` field):

- ``SessionStart``    — once, when a session begins
- ``UserPromptSubmit``— each time the user submits a prompt
- ``PreToolUse``      — before a tool call runs (may block / rewrite it)
- ``PostToolUse``     — after a tool call runs (may inject feedback)
- ``Stop``            — when the agent would end its turn (may force-continue)

The remaining reference events (``PermissionRequest``, ``PreCompact``,
``PostCompact``, ``SubagentStart``, ``SubagentStop``) are recognized by the
engine but wired opportunistically as DeepCode grows the matching kernel seams.
