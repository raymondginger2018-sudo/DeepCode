"""LoopTask — the autonomous, test-driven Ralph loop (P3 centrepiece).

Given a goal and a test command, run rounds until the tests are green (or a
circuit breaker fires). Each round:

1. **reset + handoff** — build a *fresh* :class:`AgentSession` (so context
   never grows without bound) seeded with the goal, an accumulated handoff
   note (what's been tried and why it failed — the failure ratchet), and the
   latest real test output;
2. run the agent turn (it edits files on disk, which persist across rounds);
3. **checkpoint** the workspace with a shadow-git snapshot;
4. **test backpressure** — actually run the tests and read the exit code;
5. record the round to durable :class:`LoopState` and let the declarative
   :func:`decide` policy call continue / stop.

Everything load-bearing is assembled from P0–P2: the round is a normal
``AgentSession`` (P1/P2 kernel + tools + memory), the checkpoint is the P2.d
``Snapshotter``, the truth is a real test run. The round runner and test
runner are injected, so the whole orchestration is unit-testable offline with
a scripted "agent".
